**DSGO** (*Data Structure Graphical Observer*) is a visualizer for data structures (Hash Table, AVL tree, 2-3-4 tree, Heap, Trie and Graph).

User can interact with the data structures by adding, removing and searching for elements. The program will show the changes in the data structures in real time. Overall, the application provides a "video player" for observing structures. User can also change the speed of the animation and the color theme of the data structures. The program also supports loading data structures from presaved files.
